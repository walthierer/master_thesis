ower cuts in his area and that it is impossible for him and his family to charge mobile phones, etc. 
So Amanyara remembers that there was a training about building a „DIY Solar Generator“ and he decides to conduct this training. 
His college told him that the training was the last time two years ago. So he opens the home directory of his hubs gitHub account and searches for it. 
After finding it, he oversees the content and checks if it’s still up to date. He finds a few flaws in the document and wants to improve them. 


Changing the schedule / methodology during the training 
Amanyara wants to do a training about the use of media in problem solving and handling situations locally in the refugee camp. 
The participants were selected by the community leader and should have some experience in the use of online media. 
When the team arrived there, they had to find out the audience was completely different. They planed to discuss certain topics with media advanced participants, 
but instead they talked to media newbies. So they have to change the methodology, because if they would continue with their schedule the team probably could not 
achieved a single result.
The team decided to do a basic computer training (how to use google, what is a mouse, what is a text processing program, etc.). 
So he opens the home directory of his hubs gitHub account and searches for the learning resource for a basic computer training.
